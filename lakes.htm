                 <p style="font-size:18px;color:#03225C;">Lying just north of the town centre, Lake Hora is the wildest of Bishoftu's lakes and features some outstanding birdlife along its lushly vegetated slopes. There's a footpath around the lake, but never go alone as theft is a real concern. Sadly there's no reliable local guide that can be recommended in the area. On the first Sunday following Meskel, the Oromo people celebrate Irecha here. Thanks are given to Waka (One God) and good fortune is sought for the upcoming planting season. Devotees gather around an ancient fig tree to smear perfume, butter and katickala (a distilled alcohol) on the trunk and share ceremonial meals.<br><br><br><span class="sh" style="margin-left: 10px">To get its location click the link shown below:<br><a href="https://mapcarta.com/W26555349" style="margin-left:10px">Hora lake on google map</a></span></p>

                <h3 style="color:#0000FF"; align="center"><b>Cheleleka Lake</b></h3> 
                 <p style="font-size:18px;color:#03225C;">Shallow Lake Cheleleka, 2km west of the main roundabout, is a birdwatcher favourite, and lesser flamingos as well as pelicans and various species of waterfowl are sometimes seen. As it's not a crater lake, Chelekleka lacks the dramatic scenery of other lakes in the area. A fleeting seasonal lake that only forms during the rainy season (July-August) and slowly dries as the sun re-emerges from February onward. Home to a range of indigenous birds, eagle-eyed visitors will spot the groups of pink feathered flamingos and migratory cranes bobbing in its waters. These birds usually frequent this lake during the early months of the year, migrating to cooler climates as summer approaches.<br><br><br><span class="sh" style="margin-left: 10px">To get its location on google map click the link shown below:<br><a href="https://mapcarta.com/N4681736609" style="margin-left:10px">Cheleleka Lake on google map</a></span></p><hr>

                 <p style="font-size:18px;
                 color:#03225C;">Lake Babogaya (formerly named Bishoftu Guda) is the site of most of Bishoftu's high-end resorts. With its beautiful backdrop of volcanic Mt Yerer, this circular lake is scenic to boot. Found 1.5km further north than Hora Lake, these two lakes are the smallest of the lot, however the gradual expansion of the town into the wilderness - as well as a number of resorts springing up on its shores - means they are some of the most accessible. Known for their year round beauty, these two lakes are some of the more popular, mainly due to the water park and resort found on its shore.<br><br><br><br><span class="sh" style="margin-left: 10px">To get its location on google map click the link shown below:<br><a href="https://mapcarta.com/W26555344/Map" style="margin-left:10px">Lake Babogaya on google map</a></span></p><hr>

                 color:#03225C;">Lake Bishoftu, which lies immediately south of the town centre, is the closest to the rest of the town. The lake is accessible via a steep cattle path, and is often frequented by tourists and locals alike, particularly during the warm summer months, where they have been known to swim within its water.The best way to appreciate this scenic body of water is from the crater rim at one of the hotels, drink in hand. The view is sensational. According to local lore, this, the second-deepest lake in Ethiopia, is home to a sleeping devil. From time to time his evil gases kill the fish and send them bobbing to the surface to be scooped up by delighted waterbirds.<br><br><br><span class="sh" style="margin-left: 10px">To get its location on google map click the link shown below:<br><a href="https://mapcarta.com/W26555350" style="margin-left:10px">Lake Bishoftu on google map</a></span></p><hr>

There are some tourist towing services that build in traditional style and provide excellent accommodation bed space services.  Currently a potential source of income is based on providing a full range of lodging bed services.  There is a large 5 star hotel called Kuriftu  near the lake.<br>
