						<p style="color:#d9d8d6">Lying one kilometre to the north of Bishoftu, Hora lake is the largest of the five, and is one of the most travelled with boats often seen upon the lake.

For this reason, it is not advisable to swim far into its depths, however there are a number of jetties along its shore with boats and captains for hire.

The price is dependent on the length of the trip, however a good guide price is around 40-60 Birr per boat.</p>

						<p style="color:#d9d8d6">A fleeting seasonal lake that only forms during the rainy season (July-August) and slowly dries as the sun re-emerges from February onward.

Home to a range of indigenous birds, eagle-eyed visitors will spot the groups of pink feathered flamingos and migratory cranes bobbing in its waters.

These birds usually frequent this lake during the early months of the year, migrating to cooler climates as summer approaches.</p>

Known for their year round beauty, these two lakes are some of the more popular, mainly due to the water park and resort found on its shore.</p>
